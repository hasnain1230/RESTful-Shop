# RESTful-Shop
This is a RESTful API that I created using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and other web based technologies that are intended to simulate an actual shop; this is a back-end API; I may develop a front end. I am still working on this project, but intend to finish it by the end of the semester. 

## Introduction
My intention for this project is to simulate a real shop and to treat it as if it were something I would develop in the real world. I want to populate this API with "real" products (and some humor in it too), "real" orders, and a variety of other features that a platform like Shopify would have and use on a daily basis in the form of an HTTP request.

## Documentation
I am still working on this project and would like to finish it by the end of the semester as I am very busy right now. This project has been lots of fun so far; being able to develop and create my own API rather than calling APIs for once. 

## Final Notes For Now
This project has taught me a lot about the web so far. For example, how everything is just an HTTP request and the very foundation of the internet is based on this protocol (for the most part). I hope one day I can design a system like this and/or similar to this or work on an exisiting back-end API and write updated documentation because so many developers around the world create wonderful projects with the work these RESTful APIs do.
